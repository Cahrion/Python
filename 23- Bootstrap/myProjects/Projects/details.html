 Poverty is one of the most important and worldwide problems. Poverty is the inability to have enough income and access to meet all or a large part of daily basic needs such as food and protection. Poverty, which has always been a big problem from the past to the present, prevents the development of humanity for centuries.

Poverty; arises from situations such as corruption, tax evasion, colonialism, discrimination, and selfishness. In addition to these, disasters such as fires, landslides, earthquakes, epidemics also cause poverty. Another important reason for poverty is the people's perspective on life, their insatiable desires, self-centered attitudes, and most importantly, their thought that happiness in life can only be achieved with money and the resulting dissatisfaction.

Managers employ their employees at minimum wages to buy more objects. Banks pay exorbitant interest rates to earn more money. States pay more taxes from their people to be richer than other states, and they produce skyscrapers and palaces just for show. The greatest effects of this are evident in developed or developing countries. For example, only one maintenance cost of the Eiffel Tower in France is 300 Million Euros. According to 2017 data, a total of 8.8 million people live in poverty in France.

According to 2008 data, more than 800 million people around the world live on less than 1.25 dollars a day. According to the data in 2019, the countries with the highest poverty rate are Democratic Congo, Mozambique, Uganda. We are waking up to the news that thousands of people around the world, including these countries, lost their lives because of not being able to fight extreme poverty. While people on one side of the world die cause of extreme poverty, on the other side a rich and luxurious life is lived.

The reason for the existence of people living on the same planet with completely opposite possibilities is also the cause of income inequality. Of course, this issue is among the important problems waiting to be solved all over the world. The first condition for people to live in their living standards is the fair distribution of income among persons around the world. Unfortunately, the income of the 10 richest countries is 77 times the income of the 10 poorest countries. Global inequality of this degree causes thousands of deaths every day.

A few items among the causes of poverty have more effect than other factors. For example, having children over capacity, high unemployment rates, not being able to pay for the work done, low education rates across the region are some of them. In particular, avoiding these substances will be a major factor in poverty reduction. Rising the number of persons enlarges both production and consumption. The substances of consumption cause poverty by increasing to a level that cannot be met in events such as natural disasters, wars and uprising. If there are more workers than the work capacity in the region, the employer reduces the cost of workers, causing the people of the region to fall into poverty. Lack of education causes a shortage of qualified personnel, and high sales and gainful jobs lead to a decrease in the money entering the region and an increase in poverty. Therefore, family planning, lifting of international sanctions, and similar reforms can provide the comfort of the people of the region and reduce poverty.

On the other hand, education has great importance in preventing unemployment and poverty. Because an educated society can easily develop, produce, and catch the age. The high unemployment and poverty rates of countries with low education levels today supports this. For example, Afghanistan's education level is very low (28.1% literacy rate - 2005). Accordingly, the unemployment rate is 40% (2016). The poverty rate is around 30% and continues to rise. The UK is one of the countries with a high level of education (99% literacy rate). Accordingly, the unemployment rate is 3.9% and the poverty rate is 7% (2005).


A strong education system and high literacy rate can provide the workforce that will contribute to the economy by processing the existing resources of that country. Also, it enables the establishment of a strong democratic environment. In an economically independent and productive society, the welfare level will increase and the poverty rate will decrease accordingly.

As a result, poverty is one of the most common problems of our age and is growing rapidly. For this reason, as the whole world, we must bond with each other and try to prevent poverty. Poverty is not stronger than humanity.
